# MagicProtectionOverhaul

Makes enchantment and resistance potion effects an expoential calculation instead of additive.

Now each level of enchantment adds 4%, and resistance adds 20%, stacks exponentially.

Note that this feels the same as vanilla at low levels, but at higher levels it's significantly weaker.

Resistance V was 100% damage reduction, but with this mod, it's 63% reduction.

Full protection IV armor was 64%, but with this mod, it's 47%.

Apotheosis's full protection VIII was 84%, but with this mod, it's 72%.
